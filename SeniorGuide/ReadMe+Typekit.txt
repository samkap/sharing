Hello & thanks for downloading Type-a-file!


Compliments:

First, let me just say how awesome you are. Well done, sir or madame! By deciding to useâ€”-NAY!--by even knowing about Type-a-file you have assured a song in your name in the great halls of our spirit fathers. May your days be many!


Installation:

1) You've already downloaded both taf-yourflavor-size.css and Meyerweb's reset.css file. Go ahead and cross this one off the list. Check!

2) Now, find your index.html or header.php file for your website. If you have a simple one-page website, just look for the index.html. If you have a Wordpress or other site with a content management system, most likely there's a header.php (or similarly named) file that holds the header for your entire site. If you change that file it will affect the whole site.

3) Open that file in a text or code editor. You should notice the "head" tag (<head> This spot right here </head>). If you don't see it, you've got the wrong file. Go fish! If you DO see it, Copy and paste the following code before ALL other CSS files:

<link class="type-a-file" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text/css" href="reset.css" />
<link class="type-a-file" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text/css" href="taf-flavorname-size.css" />

3) Now, you'll notice the second href element reads "taf-flavorname-size.css." That's a GENERIC name. Change that to the name of your flavor and size. For example: href="taf-kickoff-m.css".

4) Now, upload that file back to your site along with both .css files. Make sure they're in the same folder as the index.html or header.html file.

5) Add any other .css files AFTER these files. You want to use these as the foundation for your site, so leave them first!

6) Sign up for a free or paid typekit account at http://www.typekit.com. Follow Typekit's instructions for creating a kit and connecting it to your site.

7) Give yourself a high-five!
