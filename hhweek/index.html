      <h2>November 10 &ndash; 18, 2012 </h2>
      
      
  
    <p class="abouttext">Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week is your chance to make Austin a better place to live for everyone. The <a href="http://www.austinecho.org/">Ending Community Homelessness Coalition</a> (ECHO) is showcasing the city's most active organizations that work to end homelessness and hunger here. Learn about these organizations and make an informed choice about where your volunteer hours will make the greatest impact.</p>
<p style="color:#b4b4b4">Emergency shelters and street-level outreach help, but transitional and permanent housing are proven to address the long-term needs of homeless individuals and families. Rapid re-housing can assist homeless individuals successfully move to, and stay in, conventional housing. Identifying and preventing at-risk people from becoming homeless in the first place is even better. Austin only lacks the will, not the power. You can help.
